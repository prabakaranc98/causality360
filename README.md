all in causality - learnings from intro, theory, applications and research ; experiments to build better understanding/utilities


Books to Keep the Learning Grounded and Real - Cuz Learning Causality from free online sources might make you feel underwhelming and many resources are not covering enough foundationas

Books by Judea Pearl - As a pioneer of the field, one can get start with pearl's book - know that pearlian framework is different from Potential Outcomes Framework of economics or econometrics. 
(no matter what - Read 1 and 2 of Pearl, then take up based on what you want to do in Causality)

1. Book of Why - It's a very popular science book to bring the idea and need of causality to mass reading population
2. Causal Inference in Statistics - Primer - A very Stats- friendly introduction ,
3. CAUSALITY: MODELS, REASONING,AND INFERENCE - This is a very detailed book from pearl, not just about statistical way of doing causal inference, but covers philosopy, more math, and also how the idea of causality (pearlian) evolved.

  
4. Peters et al - Elements of Causal Inference ; - this book stands on top of statistical/machine learning point of view in Causality as the authors have published papers on causal representation learning


For more applied use cases
- Chernozhukov et al - https://causalml-book.org/ - Causal Machine Learning - More Practical and applied side of causality

For those who interested in Causality and Artificial Intelligence : 
- Elias Bareinboim 's Causal Aritificial Intelligence book - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hqsszr6g4nLDq2fhcQ9WEwtn4OQy0byF/view

There are two other books I was using previously : - they conver python examples, 
- Causal Inference and Discovery - Aleksandar Molak
- Causal Inference in Python - Matheus Facure

Few other books :
